Harmonic Oscillator: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/harmonic_oscillator.jl

Hydrogen Atom: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/hydrogen_atom.jl

Particle in a box: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/particle_in_a_box.jl

Heilium Atom: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/helium_atom.jl

It will take some time to start and run for the fist time as it has to download the package `Plots.jl`, so please be patient 😄
