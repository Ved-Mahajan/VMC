# VMC
This repository contains all the codes used to generate the plots used in the porject report on the topic Variational Monte Carlo. I have also included the simulation results as a `.csv` file in the folder `data`. 

# Run the code online on Binder.

In order to run the codes online, paste these links in https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/ and click on the link that the website generates.

Harmonic Oscillator: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/harmonic_oscillator.jl

Hydrogen Atom: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/hydrogen_atom.jl

Particle in a box: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/particle_in_a_box.jl

Heilium Atom: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/helium_atom.jl

It will take some time to start and run for the fist time as it has to download the package `Plots.jl`, so please be patient ðŸ˜„

PS: There is a file included for particle in a box which is not included in the report as it needs some more working.
