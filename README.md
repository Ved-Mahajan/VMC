# Run the code online on Binder.

In order to run the codes online, paste these links in https://pluto-on-binder.glitch.me/ and click on the link that the website generates.

Harmonic Oscillator: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/codes/harmonic_oscillator.jl

Hydrogen Atom: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/codes/hydrogen_atom.jl

Particle in a box: https://github.com/Ved-Mahajan/VMC/blob/master/codes/particle_in_a_box.jl

It will take some time to start and run for the fist time as it has to download the package `Plots.jl`.
